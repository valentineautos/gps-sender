GPS with speedo as shown in the Garage Tinkering video at https://youtu.be/RdmgdWnIlKY

Note. After the end of this video I removed the function that counted through the numbers as it was causing a weird feeling of chasing the true speed yet always being out of snyc, and instead upped the GPS refresh rate to 10Hz, which is its maximum.

This has VASTLY improved the end experience, and now when driving in the car it seems a lot more accurate as it reflects the true speed several times a second!
